is closely related to the [[excess]] such that:
Let $(M,d)$ be a metric space and let $c:I=[0,1] \rightarrow c(I)\subset M$
be a [[homeomorphism]].
and the points $p,q,r \in c(I)$, such that $\hat{qr}$  is the arc of $c(I)$ between $q,r$ 
and the $qr$ is the line segment.

where $l(\cdot)$ denotes the length of the segment (could be [[distance]])
and because $\frac{l(\hat{qr}}{d(q,r)} \rightarrow 1$ then we can write it as:

and the notion of [[excess]] is in:

where e is the [[excess]] and d is the [[distance]]
