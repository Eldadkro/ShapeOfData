A [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")  between two [topological spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") is a **homeomorphism** if it has the following properties:

- f is a [bijection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection "Bijection") ([one-to-one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function "Injective function") and [onto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onto "Onto")),
- f is [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_(topology) "Continuity (topology)"),
- the [inverse function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function "Inverse function") $f^{-1}$  is continuous ( f ![f](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/37bb13ba6252c62ec1ba3585ee347d35ef2b3b0f) is an [open mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_mapping "Open mapping")).
